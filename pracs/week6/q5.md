# Explain the provided code snippet

```
idx = unidrnd(60000, 6000, 1);
```

Line 3 creates random numbers for a discrete uniform distribution with a
maximum of 60000. The third and fourth parameter determines the size, so
6000x1 matrix.

```
x = train_X(idx, :);
```

Line 4 indexes the rows of the `train_X` array, returning an array of size
6000x784. [CHECK] This is effectively sampling the data down to only 6000
values

```
labels = train_labels(idx);
```

Line 5 will index the `train_labels` array at the indexes specified by `idx`
