" In order to speed up the optimization and to avoid poor local minima, a relatively large momentum term is added to the gradient. In other words, the current gradient is added to an exponentially decaying sum of previous gradients in order to determine the changes in the coordinates of the map points at each iteration of the gradient search."

# Lines 51-53
If its not the initial solution, multiply the P-values by 4.
This is used to avoid poor local minima

# Lines 87-89
Tells the program to stop lying about the p-values when it reaches 100
iterations.
