\section*{Question 1.2}

The first column of the data is the date, the second column appears to be a
unique ID for each entry.

The third column contains numbers between 25 and 30, this is possibly a
temperature in degrees. The values also change gradually which seems correct
for the given time intervals

The fourth column contains numbers between 26 and around 50000. If this is
plotted against the ID field, it produces a line.

The fifth column contains numbers between 7.3 and 8.3, with a mean of 7.846 and
a standard StdDev of 0.142. This suggests that the value doesn't change much.

It could possibly be weather data, containing temperature, humidity, etc.

The computed KL values are listed in the table below
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        M and H1 & -1.1571 \\
        M and K1 & -0.6840 \\
        M and K2 &  1.2875 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

There was an issue encountered while finding these variables, it was caused by the 0 values in some of the bins of the histogram estimator, this was corrected by
